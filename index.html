        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Pearl Supapisal and I am a first-year business student at the University of California, Riverside. In two years I plan to attend the School of Business at my school to pursue management. My family owns two Thai restaurants and my future goal is to expand that restaurant all over the world. However, a bigger goal I have is to open my own bakery and sweets shop. I am very passionate about baking and desserts, so I want to pursue my own plan while helping my parents also. My biggest role model in the business field is my dad. My dad is a single dad trying to raise a child on his own. He worked long hours and budgeted severely to get me where I am today. Everything that I do in life is for my dad and to let him one day live comfortably without having to work. On a regular day, I wake up at 7am to workout (because I am a gym rat) and then start school at 9. I go into the restaurant everyday to help with backstock or staffing, so it keeps me relatively busy. In my free time I like to hike or watch anime! I feel like anime has affected me a lot in my life. It taught me patience, trust, and grit. These are the three of my strongest qualities that I could bring into any workforce. I love to hike because it is the only time I get to just breathe and be with myself. The climb up is difficult and sometimes I just want to give up, but once I get to the top all that work is worth is. I feel like that's how life is too. We do all these things that we donâ€™t want to do to get to what we want. But once we get to the top, all that work kind of dissolves. When it comes to work, I have worked at four places. My first job was at Plato's Closet as a sales associate which introduced me to the world of customer service. This then led me to ShareTea which taught me how to work fast and efficiently, followed by my parents' restaurant that I have to get groceries and do backstock for which taught me the insider to owning a restaurant. Lastly, I have recently picked up tutoring for 8th grade math students. This really taught me patience and how to control the room. Leadership is a big quality that people look for, so as a Leo I think I am qualified for that position. Something that I live by in life is to just do it (like NIKE said). I am not afraid to make decisions that might benefit or harm me because I'll never know till I try. Life is all about trying new things and constantly growing because if you donâ€™t grow in life, there is no purpose. I love to constantly learn and better myself day by day.
